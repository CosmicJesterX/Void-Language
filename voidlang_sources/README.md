# 🌑 Welcome to the Voidlang Sources

If you are reading this, you have already been affected.

- To add source: create a file, fill it with code, and doubt.
- If your code runs, you are doing it wrong.
- If your code fails, congratulate yourself.
- Ritual suggestion: name your first file after your least favorite bug.

Enjoy the emptiness. It’s the only thing that can’t be deleted.
